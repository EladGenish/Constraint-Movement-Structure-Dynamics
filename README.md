# Constraint-Movement-Structure-Dynamics
A generative framework for co-producing structure and subjects
# Constraint–Movement–Structure Dynamics

This repository contains a theoretical framework formalizing how structure arises, persists, and reshapes agents through a recursive dynamic:

Constraint → Movement → Structure → Constraint

An explicit adaptive carrier of state — the **Node** — is introduced to capture how individuals, groups, or societies evolve alongside the structures they produce.

## Core Idea

Structure is not arbitrary and not externally imposed.
It is crystallized movement that successfully mitigated constraint in the past and therefore persists by re-imposing constraint in the future.

The framework explains:
- why humans must produce structure,
- why structure persists even when constraining,
- and how agents themselves are transformed across cycles.

## Core Objects

- **Constraint (C)**  
  Any limitation on viable states or actions (environmental, biological, epistemic, social).

- **Movement (M)**  
  Generated activity under constraint. Selection pressure is imposed by constraint, regardless of intentionality.

- **Structure (S)**  
  Movement that successfully mitigates constraint and therefore persists.

- **Node (N)**  
  The adaptive carrier of state (individual, group, institution, or society).  
  Not a metaphysical subject, but a stateful system that evolves across cycles.

## Generative Dynamics

(C_t, N_t) → M_t → S_t → C_{t+1}  
N_{t+1} = Φ(N_t, S_t, C_t)

The Node is shaped, empowered, or degraded depending on how structure constrains or enables future movement.

## Canonical Regimes

- **Co-Evolution**: structure reduces constraint and expands Node capacity  
- **Structural Capture**: structure persists by constraining the Node  
- **Mismatch / Collapse**: structure no longer mitigates constraint

Invariant:
Sustained stasis is impossible. Constraint that does not induce movement is system failure.

## Status

Research in prep.

This is a framework paper intended to be extended, tested, and instantiated across domains
(social systems, institutions, identity formation, AI, and adaptive systems).
